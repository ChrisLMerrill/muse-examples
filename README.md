# Examples for the Muse test framework

This is a project containing examples for the [Muse Test Framework](https://github.com/ChrisLMerrill/muse), which is required for running these examples.

Clone it and open the folder with [MuseIDE](http://ide4selenium.com) to run them. Note that the custom java step example will not run until the java sources have been compiled. In the examples folder, run (Java 10+ is required):

    gradlew build

Binary distributions of these examples as well as the Muse Test Framework and MuseIDE is available at: http://ide4selenium.com/#/download
